# Create Understrap Backbone
_Create Understrap Backbone is a tool designed to be used in the [Understrap Framework Theme](https://github.com/Gergab00/understrap-framework-theme) for scaffolding WordPress plugins like blocks, theme elements, and supporting files. Generates PHP, JS, CSS code and everything necessary to create everything necessary in the project. Integrates a modern build configuration without configuration._

_It is inspired by [WordPress Create Block](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/create-block) and [Antonella Framework](https://antonellaframework.com/en/)._
